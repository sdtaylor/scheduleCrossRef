	DONE make csv for SNRE
        DONE make csv for WEC
        go through and label unique classes so that classes vs sections of that class can be summarized
		probably just match the class name, those are pretty unique
	-I probably won't do this, just listing all the sections and the expandable details is fine

 	DONE       lookup history of a class in past schedules to see how often it's been offered

	DONE list whether they are special topcis or not

	DONE adding collapsable 'child rows'
		https://datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html
